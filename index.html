Chelsea


Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London. <br> Chelsea are among England's most successful clubs, having won over thirty competitive honours, including six league titles and seven European trophies. Their home ground is Stamford Bridge.[4]

Chelsea won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970 and their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: they have won five Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League titles and two UEFA Europa League titles during this period.</p>
